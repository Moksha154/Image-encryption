Here's a step-by-step guide to running the imcrypt task:

Step 1: Install the imcrypt package

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:


Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
npm install -g imcrypt
This will install the imcrypt package globally on your system.

Step 2: Prepare an image file

Choose an image file (e.g., myImage.png, myImage.jpg, or myImage.jpeg) that you want to encrypt. Make sure the file is in the same directory as your terminal or command prompt.

Step 3: Encrypt the image file

Run the following command to encrypt the image file:


Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
imcrypt -e myImage.png -i encryptedImage.png -p key.txt
Here:

-e or --encrypt flag specifies that you want to encrypt the image.
myImage.png is the input image file.
-i or --outputImageFileName flag specifies the output encrypted image file name.
encryptedImage.png is the output encrypted image file name.
-p or --outputKeyFileName flag specifies the output key file name.
key.txt is the output key file name.
Step 4: Verify the encryption

After running the command, you should see a success message indicating that the image has been encrypted successfully. You should also see two new files in your directory: encryptedImage.png (the encrypted image file) and key.txt (the encryption key file).

Step 5: Decrypt the image file (optional)

If you want to decrypt the image file, run the following command:


Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
imcrypt -d encryptedImage.png -k key.txt -i decryptedImage.png
Here:

-d or --decrypt flag specifies that you want to decrypt the image.
encryptedImage.png is the input encrypted image file.
-k or --key flag specifies the input key file.
key.txt is the input key file.
-i or --outputImageFileName flag specifies the output decrypted image file name.
decryptedImage.png is the output decrypted image file name.
Step 6: Verify the decryption

After running the command, you should see a success message indicating that the image has been decrypted successfully. You should also see a new file in your directory: decryptedImage.png (the decrypted image file).

That's it! You've successfully encrypted and decrypted an image file using the imcrypt CLI tool.
